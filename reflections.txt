# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used the terminal-table gem to print the lists in a table.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) The ability to delete multiple items at a time by passing multiple values
     into the delete method.
  b) The ability to change the priority of an item by passing the index and the
     new priority into the update_priority method.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Two hours.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I liked figuring out how to use the case statement in Ruby, as well as how to
accept any number of arguments (when deleting multiple items).
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I added the ability to delete multiple items because I wanted to learn how to
pass multiple arguments to a method, and I added the ability to change the
priority of an item because that's a useful thing for a todo list to have.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I can improve on my use of Gems, and do a better job at finding Gems
that work well for me. I also worried I repeated myself too much in certain
areas.
